#### I am a _Junior Software Developer_ who loves to code and hack.
I usually prefer Python and vim for programming but I am open-minded.
I have a strong commitment to open source software and enjoy working
with Linux but I am also familiar with Microsoft Windows.
Please feel free to take a look at my projects on Github.
